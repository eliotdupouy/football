# Ligue 1 dataset

The `ligue1-2025-26.json` file is generated by `scripts/generateLigue1Data.mjs`. The script pulls the latest FC 25 squad data scraped from [fifacm.com](https://www.fifacm.com) via the [`PabloJRW/FC25-Players-ETL`](https://github.com/PabloJRW/FC25-Players-ETL) project and shapes it into the structure consumed by the preview app.

Run the generator to refresh the bundle:

```sh
node scripts/generateLigue1Data.mjs
```

The script uses `curl` internally so no extra dependencies are required.
